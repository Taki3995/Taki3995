## Hi, im Antonia ðŸ‘‹

Civil Engineering student in Data Science at PUCV, passionate about turning data into smart decisions. I specialize in statistical analysis, machine learning, and Python programming, applying this knowledge to projects with real-world data to solve specific problems.
I have educative experience in predictive modeling, database management, and developing algorithms that optimize processes and support strategic decisions. I enjoy working with structured and unstructured data, and I always strive for my solutions to be reproducible, efficient, and actionable.
I'm currently focused on applying all of this in operational contexts, especially in infrastructure and energy. I'm always open to collaborating, learning, and building impactful solutions.

## ðŸš€ technical skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++, SQL
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Models and Techniques**: Theoretical and practical knowledge in supervised and unsupervised machine learning (regression, classification, clustering), neural networks, support vector machines (SVMs), dimensionality reduction, and association rules.
Experience in data exploration, cleaning, and transformation, multidimensional visualization, and comprehensive analysis in Python. Knowledge of information retrieval (vector and probabilistic models, inverted indexing, relevance assessment), categorization, and text compression. Design and implementation of relational databases, including conceptual, logical, and physical modeling, normalization, indexing, query processing (DDL/DML), and DBMS fundamentals.
- **Languages**: English B2 (Certified by Cambridge), German (A1 in progress).
